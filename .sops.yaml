# The public keys of each host for encryption are formed from
# /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key

# This means that when reinstalling the host or reconfiguring sshd,
# the key will change and will not be able to decipher the secret. 
# When reinstalling, you need to replace the public key here with the current one.
# In order not to lose access to secret files, there is a primary key.
# ! The primary key can decrypt any secret and must be stored in a safe place
# ! Ideally, it can be printed and provided with a QR code for quick copying.
# ! Never store the primary key on one of the machines described in the config.

# For greater security, each host or user has its own directory and *.yaml secret files
# This is done intentionally so that if a host is compromised it will not affect others.

# Below is the current hierarchy of secret files:

# ./secrets
# ├── homes
# │   └── stepan
# │       └── secrets.yaml
# └── hosts
#     ├── desktop-laptop
#     │   └── secrets.yaml
#     ├── desktop-workstation
#         └── secrets.yaml
